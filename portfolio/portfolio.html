                <h4>About Me...</h4>
                <p>I'm a humble husband and father of two. Loving every minute I can spend with my family. I have been interested with computers and software since elementary school. Over the last year started to learn to code and have enjoyed every moment of building different programs. Wrote, analyzed, reviewed, and rewrote programs, using workflow chart and diagram, and applied knowledge of computer capabilities, subject matter, and symbolic logic.</p>
